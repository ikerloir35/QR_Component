## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- External Assets

### What I learned

Include assets from external sources:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.gooleapis.com/css?family=Outfit" />
```

Using flexbox for item positioning

```css
.main-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  padding: 16px 16px 40px 16px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  max-width: 320px;
}
```

### Continued development

On the next projects i will like to focus and work on the layout design, using Grids and Flexbox. Also, i would like to implement pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

### Useful resources

These two sources from w3schools.com have been really helpfull while coding my solution. They have a clear index, easy to use search input, and try yourself web coding solution.
